Creating the mini app with Loveable and N8N Workflow

Prompt to give in Loveable:
Hey I would like you to create me a visually engaging beautifully designed dark theme dashboard that's going to display comprehensive business analytics and KPI metrics.
 I want this to pull real-time data from my Google Sheets database and refresh automatically every time the application loads. 
 The dashboard should feature modern glassmorphism effects, smooth animations, and interactive data visualizations including revenue trends, user engagement metrics,
  conversion funnels, and performance indicators. I need it to have a sleek cyberpunk aesthetic with neon accents, gradient backgrounds, and hover effects that make 
  the interface feel alive and dynamic. The layout should be responsive and include customizable widgets that can be rearranged. Please make it look absolutely stunning 
  with cutting-edge design elements that would make someone stop and say 'wow' - something that feels like it belongs in a high-tech control room. 

Here's my Google Sheets link for the data integration.
